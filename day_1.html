                        Lugaw's simple ingredients make it easy to digest, <br>
                        but it benefits you from the inside of the stomach.

                    <li>
                        Lugaw could provide an easy-to-digest source of energy by <br>
                        cooking rice, which is abundant in carbs. The high water <br>
                        content of lugaw can increase an individual's overall fluid <br>
                        consumption throughout the day, hence preventing dehydration.

                        Sisig is a rich source of protein, with each meal having around <br>
                        30-40 grams. Protein is necessary for tissue development and <br>
                        repair, and it can also make you feel full after eating.

                        Apples are high in nutrients such as fiber, vitamin C, and <br>
                        antioxidants, which can promote healthy digestion, cognitive <br>
                        health, and weight management. There is evidence that apples <br>
                        can protect against certain serious illnesses such as cancer, <br>
                        heart disease, and type 2 diabetes.
